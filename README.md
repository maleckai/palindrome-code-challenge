# Palindrome Checker

A function that will take a string as input, and output true or false depending on whether or not it is a palindrome.

This was created as part of a code challenge, and had the additional restriction that any built in string reverse functions could not be used.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'palindrome', :git => 'https://github.com/maleckai/palindrome-code-challenge.git'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself by pulling down the repository and then running:

    $ rake install

## Usage

Run
 
    $ palindrome <string>

to check if the inputted string is a palindrome.
